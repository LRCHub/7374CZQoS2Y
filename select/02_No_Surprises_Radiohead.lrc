[00:25.65] A heart that's full up like a landfill
[00:35.22] A job that slowly kills you
[00:41.51] Bruises that won't heal
[00:53.01] 
[00:51.62] You look so tired, unhappy
[00:57.69] Bring down the government
[01:04.17] They don't, they don't speak for us
[01:21.67] 
[01:16.75] I'll take a quiet life
[01:22.34] A handshake of carbon monoxide
[01:28.91] No alarms and no surprises
[01:35.25] No alarms and no surprises
[01:41.30] No alarms and no surprises
[01:47.68] Silent
[01:54.06] Silent
[01:57.06] 
[02:00.88] This is my final fit
[02:06.04] My final bellyache with
[02:13.48] No alarms and no surprises
[02:19.52] No alarms and no surprises
[02:25.55] No alarms and no surprises, please
[02:42.55] 
[02:56.06] Such a pretty house
[03:01.71] And such a pretty garden
[03:08.45] No alarms and no surprises
[03:14.05] No alarms and no surprises
[03:20.23] No alarms and no surprises, please
